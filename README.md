### Hello! 

I'm Melissa Romero, I have a bachelor's degree in economics and I'm currently learning front-end development as well with other forms of technologies to complement my formation. My biggest interest right now is Data Analysis, my studies in university brought me a fascination for data since it was always required for reading economic phenomena. Iâ€™m looking towards taking my professional career into the field of problem solving through data-driven decision making, therefore my formation in technological tools is something I'm very actively working on.
